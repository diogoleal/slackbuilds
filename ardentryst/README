Ardentryst is an open-source free game written exclusively by Jordan
Trudgett. It works to combine elements of fighting, arcade, advent-
ure, RPG and sidescrolling games to give the game a very unique
genre. Its aim is to provide an enjoyable game to people of many ages
from young to old, and to appeal to many types of gamers.

Ardentryst works much like any other platform game in a bigger sense:
when you play the game, you move from level to level to play them, and
after each, you unlock the next. The goal is, generally, to finish all
the levels.

During each level, there are noticeable RPG and fantasy elements, like
the HP/MP/affliction statuses, to name a few. Many of these elements
have been carried over from traditional RPGs, like buying/selling
items, attack/defence/endurance/luck/level-based character development,
and of course, many different weapons and equipment to choose from.

The game also incorporates fighting-style combos in conjunction with
magic spells for advanced battles.
