esmtp is a user configurable relay-only Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) with a
sendmail compatible syntax.  It's based on <<libESMTP>> supporting the
AUTH (including the CRAM-MD5 and NTLM SASL mechanisms) and the StartTLS SMTP
extensions.

See the http://esmtp.sourceforge.net/ESMTP MTA home page for updated information.
