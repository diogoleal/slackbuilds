# Prey - Track down your stolen laptop

# A project by Tomas Pollak
##############################################

Prey is a lightweight application for tracking your stolen laptop.

It runs in Windows and *NIX systems as well (Mac, Linux). It is licensed
by the GPLv3 which means you can do just about anything with it, as long as
you respect the licence's terms.

For up to date information check the project's website at preyproject.com.

##############################################
1. How it works
##############################################

The script runs at a specified interval in your machine, and checks
for a specified URL on the web. If the URL does not exist it means the
PC has been stolen, and thus goes through the information
gathering routine and sends all that info through to a previously defined
email address. You can also not define a URL and in that case the program
will send the data every time it runs, although it is *not* recommended.

Since 0.3.3, you can use a web control panel (control.preyproject.com)
to manage your computer's state, as well as toggling different modules for
triggering certain behaviours remotely. In this case you don't have to
worry about the URL thing since it takes care of that for you. You only
need to set up your user account when installing Prey.

##############################################
2. Installation
##############################################

 -- Linux users (not Debian/Ubuntu)

Once you've downloaded the package, unzip it and move all the contents to a
folder of your choice (we use /usr/share/prey). Then you need to open up the
config file and change your settings according to your configuration. If
you're using the Control Panel, then you only need to insert your API and
Device keys; otherwise you need to set up your SMTP server settings.

Finally, you need to add a crontab entry for root. You can do this by typing
the following in a terminal:

$ (sudo crontab -l | grep -v prey; echo "*/20 * * * * /usr/share/prey/prey.sh > /var/log/prey.log") | sudo crontab -

3. Requisites for Linux
##############################################

Mac comes with everything needed to run Prey. However Linux users should make
sure they have the following installed: (note the installer does this
automatically!)

	o curl / wget
	o scrot or imagemagick (for screenshot capture)
	o streamer (for webcam capture) --> in Fedora the xawtv package includes it
	o Perl libs IO::Socket::SSL and NET::SSLeay

##############################################
4. Usage
##############################################

The idea is that when your laptop gets stolen -- hopefully never, that is --
you should immediately activate Prey, by marking the device as missing
in the Control Panel, or by deleting the URL you specified in Prey's
configuration. This depends on the operation mode (post method) you set up
when installing Prey.

Prey expects a status code 404 to run. If it receives a status 200 it will
simply shut down and wait for the next interval to check the URL.

##############################################
5. Troubleshooting
##############################################

Prey has a 'check mode' to verify it's settings are correct.
Prey can also be run manually by removing the '--check' argument, Prey will 
begin running immediately. It will try to contact the Control Panel (or a 
custom server) & send a report if it detects it is marked as missing. You 
should see the results of this process echoed directly back to your terminal 
window.

 > Check Mode - Linux & Mac
Type the following in a terminal:
$ sudo /usr/share/prey/prey.sh --check

 > Full run - Linux & Mac
Type the following in a terminal:
$ sudo /usr/share/prey/prey.sh
